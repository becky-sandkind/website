### Experienced Consultant

I am an experienced consultant helping teams to align and evolve their organisations so together they can create impact at scale in an ever changing world.

After 20 years of working in 34 teams in mostly large organisations, my work is also evolving, it's time for me to be more nimble.

Sandkind is simply my Limited company that enables me to choose my clients and still work alongside thought-leaders and deep practitioners.

I combine experience with leading knowledge from agile, software, DevOps, data and organisational design communities, to create evidenced-based learning and advice.
