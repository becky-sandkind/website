## Hey, I'm Becky

### Experienced Consultant

Becky is an experienced consultant helping teams to redesign their ways of working for faster flow within their evolving ecosystem of people and tech.

Sandkind is my way to create purposeful impact.

After 20 years of working in 34 teams in mostly large organisations, it’s time to be more nimble.

Purpose: to enable emerging digital and data leaders with the knowledge and ways of thinking:

* to bring about the change they hope is possible;
* to evolve their organisations to meet the many challenges of today’s world; and
* to work in a sustainable way based on an understanding of our shared humanity.

Becky takes her years of experience combined with leading knowledge from agile, software, DevOps, data and organisational design communities and makes it accessible, relatable and usable for leaders and teams.
