About me, in short:

1990s - school, work, travel, university

2000s - PhD maths, set up small charity - 10 trips to Uganda, IT consultant public sector, therapy

2010s - NGO tech analyst, ThoughtWorks consultant, mum of 1

2020s - mum of 2, set up my business and myself as independent consultant
  
I have learnt that:

- work should be needs-driven and user researchers UR/UX are the key to any successful team
- strategy, team design and tech development produce the best results in a 3-way iterative collaboration. Strategy being for impact, product, organisation and/or business.
- data scientists and other specialists, given a voice, can find ways to collaborate and work asynchronously with other teams
- psychological safety is not being nice, it’s obligation to dissent
