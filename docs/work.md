Having worked across private and public sectors, whilst there are many differences I’ve also seen similarities in how organisations are evolving to enable team autonomy and faster outcomes. Technology has enabled some change but it’s also the way tech teams work and collaborate that creates scalable change.

My focus of support has therefore evolved from delivering technology to advising and supporting learning on ways of working. My advice is based on evidence from [DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA)](https://dora.dev/) and leading IT books: [Accelerate](https://itrevolution.com/product/accelerate/), [Team Topologies](https://itrevolution.com/product/team-topologies/) and the [Lean series](https://theleanstartup.com/the-lean-series), for example, and tested by experience.

I am currently working directly with clients and through [Conflux](https://confluxhq.com/about) as an Associate Principal. Conflux helps organisations navigate fast flow with Team Topologies, led by author Matthew Skelton. Through our partnership, I can also utilise Conflux sessions with my direct clients where appropriate to their learning.
