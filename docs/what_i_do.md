Sandkind is new and whilst we have grand plans to equip emerging leaders to evolve their organisations for the needs of the modern world, we are starting small.

We currently work in two ways:
For UK corporate / public sector clients - through Conflux and occasionally direct
For humanitarian / climate non-profits - direct at a discounted rate - more [link to humanitarian page]

### Conflux

Becky is an Associate Principal at Conflux
Conflux is the leading business consultancy worldwide helping organisations to navigate fast flow with Team Topologies, providing expert-led group learning to organisations worldwide.
The Conflux team is on a mission to make software delivery more team-centric, more humane, more sustainable.


### Humanitarian

Beckyâ€™s social and climate mission is to make thought-leading, tech-sector knowledge accessible and relevant for climate and social impact sectors to enable the fast flow of their work. 

Her hope is that this will speed up the systemic change needed to tackle the complex crises in climate, biodiversity, social justice. 

She currently supports this through direct work with large humanitarian organisations in the system.
