My social and climate mission is to make thought-leading, tech-sector knowledge accessible and relevant for climate and social impact sectors to enable the fast flow of their work.

My hope is that this speeds up the systemic change needed to tackle the complex crises in climate, biodiversity, social justice.

I currently support this through direct work with large humanitarian organisations in the system.
